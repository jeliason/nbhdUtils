### Questions/Analyses

  1. Are there differences in the spatial relationships of CD8+ T cells and Tregs between patient groups? Patient stage?
  2. Is there any significant interaction of immune cells and vasculature in either patient group?
  3. At what spatial scale do we observe spatial relationships of CD8+ T cells and Tregs?
