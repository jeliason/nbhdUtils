* Spatial statistics
	* Moran's I, Geary's C, G (local or not), ELSA (elsa)
	* Joint count (spdep)
	* Biodiversity analyses (functional summaries), e.g. Shannon index, etc. (spatialsegregation)
	* Ripley's K,L,pcf for determining interaction ranges
	* Spatial point process models (Gibbs, area-interaction, Geyer saturation) for interaction effect size and direction (joint or conditional on location)
	* mobsim - spatial simulation of communities
